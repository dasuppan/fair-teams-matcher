# Fair Teams Matcher

A simple algorithm for finding fair random teams based on players experience. Initially made for Minecraft Hungergames but can be used for any team-based game/sport/etc.

# Usage

A GUI is pending but in the meantime just add players with their skill rating ("XP") (range 1-5 recommended) to the static PLAYER array, set the preferred TEAMSIZE and run the application.
Teams might be more unbalanced if the amount of players cannot be split up equally.

# TODO
- GUI
